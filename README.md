#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Stage 1

This is **Stage 1** of the **Restaurant Reviews** project from Udacity's Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course.
I will incrementally convert the static webpage provided to a mobile-ready web application. In this first stage I will convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.


The original code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all.

I am updating the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### How I implement it on my local computer

After cloning the project, I open up a terminal in the local folder of the project and I start up a simple HTTP server with live reload functionality to serve up the site files.

I am currently using `live-server`, a npm package that can be found on npmjs.com.

I spin up the server with `live-server --host=localhost --port=8000`
